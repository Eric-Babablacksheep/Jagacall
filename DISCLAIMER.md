# JagaCall - Disclaimer and Limitations

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

**JagaCall is an AI-powered scam detection assistant designed for demonstration and educational purposes only. This application is NOT a substitute for professional security advice, law enforcement services, or guaranteed scam protection.**

## 📋 General Limitations

### 1. AI Accuracy Limitations

- **No 100% Accuracy**: AI analysis is not infallible and may produce false positives or false negatives
- **Context Dependent**: The AI may not understand full context, cultural nuances, or legitimate business practices

- **Language Limitations**: While optimized for English and Bahasa Malaysia, accuracy may vary with dialects, slang, or mixed languages

### 2. Technical Limitations

- **Internet Dependency**: Requires active internet connection for AI analysis
- **Processing Time**: Analysis may take several seconds depending on network conditions
- **File Size Limits**: File analysis is restricted to 10MB maximum
- **Audio Quality**: Voice analysis depends on transcript accuracy; poor audio quality affects results

### 3. Security Limitations
